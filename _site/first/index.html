<blockquote>
<p>Here, let&#8217;s talk about boobs: If group meetings are the universal antagonist, boobs are the antidote for all of life&#8217;s ills and the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, etc. Philip Roth has a short novel, The Breast, about a lecherous professor who wakes up one day and&#8230;is literally a giant boob. It&#8217;s like Kafka&#8217;s Metamorphosis for the secondary-sex-characteristically inclined. Also, not everyone hates you when you&#8217;re a boob (as opposed to Gregor the cockroach), but you can&#8217;t really do very much for yourself either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the point of bringing that up was. But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from grad school, it&#8217;s that if you try hard enough, you can make all sorts of tenuous connections into a (more or less) viable argument. So: Boobs are great, but not when you are one (or if you&#8217;re a gay man, I guess).</p>
