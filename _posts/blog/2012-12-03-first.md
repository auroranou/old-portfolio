>Here, let's talk about boobs:  If group meetings are the universal antagonist, boobs are the antidote for all of life's ills and the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, etc.  Philip Roth has a short novel, The Breast, about a lecherous professor who wakes up one day and...is literally a giant boob.  It's like Kafka's Metamorphosis for the secondary-sex-characteristically inclined.  Also, not everyone hates you when you're a boob (as opposed to Gregor the cockroach), but you can't really do very much for yourself either.

>I'm not sure what the point of bringing that up was.  But if there's one thing I've learned from grad school, it's that if you try hard enough, you can make all sorts of tenuous connections into a (more or less) viable argument.  So:  Boobs are great, but not when you are one (or if you're a gay man, I guess).
